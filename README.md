# Markdown Architectural Decision Records - Command Line Interface

`madr-cli` is a small command line interface to create and manage ADRs
(Architectural Decision Records) using [_madr_ (Markdown
ADR)](https://adr.github.io/madr/) as format.

## Objectives

`madr-cli` aims for:

- Simplicity of usage. Everything should make sense out of the box
- Configurability of madr optionnal sections
- Portability

Of course, `madr-cli` uses madr to record its own decisions ðŸ™‚
